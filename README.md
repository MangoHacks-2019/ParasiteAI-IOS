# ParasiteAI-IOS

## MangoHacks 2019

## Inspiration

Saving lives

## What it does

We took a service oriented approach. A Flask web app holds the neural network for detection, and is hosted on Google Cloud App Engine. It communicates with Client iOS app and 8Base, where business logic and predictions are handled.

## Challenges we ran into

- Putting a fully functioning ML model in production
- Communicating images via client app and flask web app
- Integration of 8Base backend with Swift


## The Process

This is the first time we've ever tried to really plan out the user interface and user experience of an application. We created some on-paper wireframes of our vision based on the goals we identified for a user, and how they might want to use the app.

### Our paper wireframes for the ParsaiteAI-IOS app

After creating wireframes, we validated them and re-created our layout for building the mobile application in Sketch and Adobe Illustrator.

### Our software-created UI prototype

## The Technology

**The ParasiteAI iOS app** 
Developed in xcode using swift 4, lottie-iOS, EightBase, Apollo, & GraphQL. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The UI/UX and app functionally.

## What we learned

Implementing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to solve a complex software design problem.

## What's next for parasite.AI

Series A funding. If all else fails, we'll go into crypto with MalariaCoin.
